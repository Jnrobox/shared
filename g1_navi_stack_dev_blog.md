**Genesis World** is a simulation platform for physical AI developments. It combines a unified multi-physics engine, a photo-realistic renderer ([Nyx](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-nyx)), and a cross-platform compiler ([Quadrants](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/quadrants)) behind a Pythonic simulation interface. Genesis World is designed to scale from a single laptop kernel to datacenter-grade GPUs, while remaining easy to read, extend, and embed in research code.

It was previously named **Genesis** and started as an academic project since Dec 2024, and its development is now officially supported by [Genesis AI](https://www.genesis.ai/).

## What is Genesis World?

![Genesis World stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YilingQiao/Genesis/readme-assets/videos/diagram_white_lum.png)

Genesis World occupies the four layers inside the dashed box. Above sits whatever you build (robotics environments, ML pipelines, data generation, agentic simulation); below sits whatever compute backend you have.

- **Simulation Interface** — the user-facing API: asset parsing (URDF, MJCF, OBJ, GLB, USD, …), entity accessors, controllers, sensors, parallel and heterogeneous environments, and a built-in GUI.
- **Physics** — a unified multi-physics engine integrating Rigid, FEM, MPM, Particle (PBD / SPH), [uipc](https://github.com/spiriMirror/libuipc), an explicit coupler, and SAP, all sharing one scene and one state.
- **Render** — three rendering paths plug in as camera sensors: **[Nyx](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/genesis-nyx)** (our in-house renderer designed for robotics), Luisa (DSL ray tracer), and Pyrender (rasterizer).
- **Compiler** — **[Quadrants](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/quadrants)** lowers Python kernel code to CUDA, AMD ROCm, Apple Metal, Vulkan, x86, and ARM64. It carries Genesis's autodiff, GPU graphs, and fastcache machinery.
